<p>I am a second year computer system engineering student.</p>
<p2>I have seen no HTML code before, so its a steep curve.
I hope to learn enough HTML that I can create a website with little stress.
I signed up for Piazza.</p2>

<p3>I am a state championship winning Ultimate Frisbee player. After playing for two years,
my team in highschool won the state championship my senior year of high school. </p3>
